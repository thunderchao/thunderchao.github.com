<h1 id="Might_as_well_blog">Might as well blog</h1><p>It’s been a while since I’ve maintained a blog with any kind of regularity, but my upcoming Fulbright to Ukraine has prompted me to start up a new one. For those of you who, like my parents, would worry without any regular updates, look! You can get your updates here. And without the mass group email.</p>
<p>I’ll still be active on twitter, but this medium allows for longer posts with more pictures and stuff. Consider it a facebook replacement that you don’t have to feel obligated to like every post or picture I put up.</p>
<p>As far as the frequency of posts, I want to put up a new one every week or so, but I imagine that occasionally I won’t be in a place with reliable internet (or that I really just didn’t do anything interesting that week).</p>
<p>But if you want to contact me while I’m in Ukraine, you should check out the <a href="/about/index.html">About</a> page that has all my contact info.</p>

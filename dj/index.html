          <h2>SETTING</h2>
          <p>Oh, it’s bad. Automation means that unless you’re an owner or lucky enough to have a job that
            requires actual human skills, you’re slumming it. Hard. So what do you do? You hustle. You scam.
            You steal. You doublecross. You make friends. And you try to stay one step ahead of everyone who’s
            trying to do the same to you.</p>
          <p>But the second tech revolution isn’t without some benefit. Most everyone gets hardwired for net
            access real young—hospitals are even offering it at birth—artificial organs can keep you alive
            and even healthier than human, provided you can either make your interest payments or stay one
            step ahead of the repo man, and cybernetic enhancements are as common as tattoos and piercings,
            if not moreso.</p>
          <p>The big corporate boys still run the show, but there's plenty of place in the middle, all those
            elevated gangsters living that petty bouj high life. Anywhere you look, somebody's trying to squeeze
            you out, shut you down, shut you up, wipe you out, co-opt you, break you down, pull one over on you.
            What can you say, it's a living.</p>
          <p>You and your crew have managed to eke out a kind of anxious stability: you’ve got your turf, and
            you’ve done well enough to not be on anyone major’s radar. Until today that is, when somebody’s
            cousin limps into the door of the pizza joint, opium den, backroom casino, Hot Topic, community
            garden, tattoo parlor, underage bar, abandoned public school gymnasium, or wherever it is you and
            your crew call home. And they’ve got bad news—some bogeyman’s decided you’ve stuck your all’s head
            out just high enough from the human filth pile to be noticed. Time to put on your danger face.</p>

            <h2>THE DECK</h2>
            <p>Your deck is your life. It controls the actions and flows of the world. You’ll be drawing through
              your deck for combat and checks—anything that requires more than casual effort. Your deck starts
              off with 27 cards: one full suit each in <red>red</red> and <black>black</black>, and one
              <joker>joker</joker>. Jacks are worth 11, queens 12, kings 13, and aces 14 when they need to be a
              number. There are a number of keywords that will come up that you need to know:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Draw. </strong>Take however many cards from your deck, put them in your hand.
                "Drawing up" is drawing enough cards to get back to max hand size (usually 5).</li>
              <li><strong>Flip. </strong>Flip the top card of your deck over and discard it. The difficulty of
                the task determines what you'll need to flip to succeed: flip target is the
                hardest, then flip ace, then flip face, then flip <black>black</black>/<red>red</red>.</li>
              <li><strong>Discard. </strong>Remove a card from your hand or deck into a face-up pile.</li>
              <li><strong>Ace. </strong>Aces are crits—both fails and hits. They do different things depending
                on context.</li>
              <li><strong>Shuffle. </strong>Shuffle your hand, discards, and deck. You shuffle after a combat
                encounter, checks, when resting in combat, and when you draw a joker.</li>
              <li><strong><joker>Joker</joker>. </strong>Drawing a <joker>joker</joker> activates your joker
                skill and has you shuffle and draw up on the spot.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The GM uses a full deck of 54 (both <joker>jokers</joker>) for his/her side of encounters—that
              means all 4 guys in that rival biker gang or whatever are drawing from the same deck. If you’re
              fighting areal tough dude though, one of those real legendary motherfuckers, the GM might use a
              separate 27-card deck just for that guy.</p>

          <h2>CHARACTERS</h2>
          <p>Characters in DECKJAMMERS have no class or race (but they are low-class and of any human race you'd
            like). Life for your character has been pretty shitty so far, and nobody expects it'll get much better.
            Except now, your back's right up against the wall—and who knows, you might even come out the other
            end a litter better off.</p>
          <p>Your crew, made up of the characters you and your friends are playing as, is a big part of your
            character's identity. You've known each other for a while at least, probably, and you've got each
            others' backs. That's not to say you're all clones or something like that; far from it. Think of any
            crew from literally any movie, tv show, book, comic, whatever: you've each got your own personalities,
            strengths, and weaknesses, but hopefully you're all different enough to cover all the bases without any
            too-gaping holes. That's why you really should all do character creation together.
          </p>
          <p>Character creation is done in three steps. 1: Get an idea for your character. What are they like?
            Actually take a minute to describe your character's personality, likes, dislikes, talents, aesthetic,
            all that, and give yourself some kind of defining characteristic: a quirk, shtick, signature item—an
            iconic element of self. Step 2 is figuring out your attributes (see below) and step 3 is buying your
            <a href="#skill">skills</a> and <a href="#shops">enhancements</a>.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <h3>Main attributes</h3>
          <p>There are five attributes: face, footwork, handeye, toughness, and smarts. Secondary attributes like HP
            and defensive stats are derived from these, and your attribute scores directly affect how well you can do
            the things you want to do. At character creation, you have 10 points to distribute among the five
            attributes, but you can’t put more than 4 points into one attribute.</p>
          <p><strong>Face</strong> is the social attribute. It’s the measurement of your charm, charisma, confidence,
            ability to successfully bullshit, negotiate, barter, inspire, and persuade.</p>
          <p><strong>Footwork</strong> is the agility attribute. More points means you’re faster and harder to hit
            with ranged attacks, like by bullets from guns.</p>
          <p><strong>Handeye</strong> is the dexterity attribute. Most of the time, this one is going to come into
            play when you’re trying to shoot things or people. Also, driving and playing videogames. And stealing.</p>
          <p><strong>Toughness</strong> is the strength attribute. It’s used for three major things: calculating
            your HP, how hard it is to damage you with a melee attack, and how well you can do melee attacks.</p>
          <p><strong>Smarts</strong> is the knowledge attribute. Need to remember something? Need to research
            something? Need to make repairs? Need to tell if someone’s lying? Need to hack some shit? Smarts is it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <h3>Derived attributes</h3>
          <p>Your HP is 1 plus your toughness score. Damage in DECKJAMMERS is abstracted fairly heavily:
            if an attack hits you, you’re most likely taking one point of damage (unless their attack was a pretty
            dope skill, in which case it’ll probably be more than one). If your HP gets to 0, you’re KO’d and all
            you can do is flip one on your turn until you’re no longer KO’d. If your HP hits your negative toughness
            score, you’re dead. We’ll get to the rules for all that later though.</p>
          <p>The order in which you’ll act in combat encounters is based on your footwork score. Depending on how
            your GM wants to do it, there’s two ways to handle initiative. The first is more dynamic but also there’s
            more to keep track of: everyone (including each bad guy) flips a card, adds their footwork score to it,
            and then you all go in descending order. In case of a tie, a <black>black</black> flipped card will always
            beat a <red>red</red> flipped card; if they’re both the same, work it out amongst yourselves. The second
            is you just go in order of highest total footwork for each side, and your crew and the bad guys acts in
            blocs.</p>
          <p>How far you can move in combat is also determined from footwork. DECKJAMMERS uses squares, like on
            those battlemat grids. A square’s either 5ft or 2m a side, or somewhere in between, depending on your
            feelings about the metric system and how big of a rules wonk nob you are. Everyone gets 4 squares of
            movement, plus one more for every point they have in footwork. Yes, that does mean you can be very,
            very fast if you want to be.</p>

      <h3><a data-toggle="collapse" href="#hobbies" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="hobbies">Optional: Hobbies</a></h3>
      <div class="row collapse" id="hobbies">
        <div class="col">
          <p>If you'd like, you can choose a hobby for your character. Each hobby has a profiency level—novice,
            amateur, adept, expert—that increases as you use your hobby. Hobbies are designed to flesh out chars
            a bit and also (potentially) help out the group as a whole. They are not tied to a specific attribute.</p>
          <p><strong>Drugs.</strong> Drugs are great for big boosts up front but with drawbacks later. Having drugs
            as a hobby also gets expensive. There is also a push-your-luck aspect here with the chance to OD.
            <ul>
              <li><em>Novice/cornerkid</em>: the pills you can get ($10/ea) give a +1 to any attribute for one encounter, but
                then a -1 to that same attribute for the next one.</li>
              <li><em>Amateur/connoseur</em>: you can now start mixing pills to get a +2 to any attribute for one encounter (with the
                same drawback as a cornerkid), but also flip every time you take (or administer) pills: <red>red ace</red>
                means you have a bad trip, and all your attributes in the next encouter are -1.</li>
              <li><em>Adept/functional addict</em>: you've got the chops to choose just the right chemicals. Your pills double in cost,
                efficacy, and in drawback. Flip: <red>red face</red> means you have a bad trip, <red>red ace</red> means
                you OD: you are immediately KO'd and you have the bad trip drawback in your next encounter.</li>
              <li><em>Expert/pharmacologist</em>: remove both Jacks from your deck. Your pills can no longer cause people to OD
                and you have to take pills every encounter.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p><strong>Cooking.</strong> Cooking meals for your crew provides small but persistent buffs for the
            whole day, and is generally cheaper than drugs, though getting your hands on some of the higher-tier
            ingredients might run up quite the tab. You can make one meal per day.
            <ul>
              <li>
                <em>Novice/cart</em>: you know one recipe, and it's eggs and spam in ramen. It's good, sure, but there's
                not a whole lot to it. It costs $5 to make a pot for the crew, and everyone can choose one card in their
                deck and add 8 to its value until the end of the day.
              </li>
              <li>
                <em>Amateur/diner</em>: you've figured out a couple more recipes. Your paninis ($3/ea) let a crewmember
                add 6 to two cards in their deck for the day and your brownies ($9/all) let everyone who eats them remove
                a red non-face card from their deck for the day.
              </li>
              <li>
                <em>Adept/restaurant</em>: you've mastered some harder recipes and you've even developed a signature dish.
                Whatever that might be (it's on the level of fanciness of like a $18 cordon bleu) gives everyone that eats it
                the ability, once per day, when they'd have to flip any number of cards, to flip one extra one and choose
                the result they'd like.
              </li>
              <li>
                <em>Expert/michelin</em>: you're good enough to win on Iron Chef for sure at this point. Everything you
                cook is now twice as fancy, meaning everything costs twice as much, but is twice as effective. Eggspamramen
                and brownies work on two cards, paninis work on 4 cards, and your signature dish lets people use that bonus
                flip ability twice in one day.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p><strong>Scavenging.</strong> Scavenging parts will get you earn you some bonus cash on the side, and
            as you get better at it, you might even find some dope shit other people have left behind (like that
            spare liver that girl had hiding in her leg).
            <ul>
              <li>
                <em>Novice/mouse</em>: you have a knack for finding loose change. After every encounter flip: you find
                money equal to the value of the card you drew.
              </li>
              <li>
                <em>Amateur/racoon</em>: when you scavenge, add 4 to the value of the card you flip. If you flipped face,
                you also find 4 rounds of ammo.
              </li>
              <li>
                <em>Adept/vulture</em>: when you scavenge, add 8 to the value of the card you flip. If you flip <black>black</black>,
                you also find as many rounds of ammo as the value of the card. If you flip face, you harvest any cyber enhancements
                from defeated (hopefully dead, lol) enemies that you can sell for 1/4 of their cost.
              </li>
              <li>
                <em>Expert/jackal</em>: when you scavenge, add 12 to the value of the card you flip. If you flip <black>black</black>,
                you also find 4+ as many rounds of ammo as the value of the card. If you flip face, you harvest any cyber enhancements
                from defeated (hopefully dead, lol) enemies that you can sell for 1/4 of their cost. If you flip ace, you find
                a hidden cache of goods worth at least $100 (though the specifics are determined by the GM).
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p><strong>Trolling.</strong> Trolling ups your crew's notoreity online and can even start to bring in
            some persistent income once you get enough fans, but it does come with the potential drawback that you'll
            attract some haters who might want to take it out on your IRL.
            <ul>
              <li><em>Novice/shitposter</em>: during a combat encounter, when you take a rest, an enemy of your choice
              flips: if <red>red face</red>, they have to discard a card at random from their hand.</li>
              <li><em>Amateur/memester</em>: make a face check as an action in combat with a target of 20 against somebody.
              If you succeed, reduce your target's max hand size by 1. If you fail, they draw 2 cards and can take an immediate
              action against you.</li>
              <li><em>Adept/shitlord</em>: your reputation is starting to precede you. At the beginning of every encounter,
                flip. If <red>red ace</red>, your enemies call in some reinforcements and another of their crew joins the
                fight. If <black>black ace</black> or <joker>joker</joker>, turns out one of your enemies is a fan of
              your antics and refuses to fight you.</li>
              <li><em>Expert/netceleb</em>: your crew has a permanent 20% discount everywhere but every time you buy
                something, flip: if <red>red face</red>, you are chased out the store and can't buy anything until
                after your next encounter.</li>
            </ul>

          <p>While you inhabit your character, your character is inseparable from your crew, so figuring out

            for. Write down your connections to and relationships with other crews: allies, enemies, rivals,
            mentors, etc. Also come up with a handful of other people that support or are at least peripheral
            to your crew: Mama Chow that owns the noodle shop you're based out of, the friendly drug dealer Kid

          <p>The monthly maintenance costs listed are baselines. Any damage done to your ride is extra to repair.
            All your rides are stolen, by the way. You have no money, remember? How the hell did you think you could
            even afford like a moped, let alone a tank?</p>
          <p>You can also mod out your ride. There are cheap mods in the $100-$200 range that can give you a small
            boost, like a NOS kit that consumes a canister to double your speed for a round or a directional satellite
            dish that double the range of your electronics. There are more expensive mods too that add much better
            bonuses, but they also add some bummers. Negotiate with your GM roleplaying a chopshop mechanic to figure
            out the deets.</p>
          <p><strong>On bonuses and bummers:</strong> these are narrative tags that you and the GM decide what they mean when you write
            them down on your list of shit your crew has. Even then though, be loose about it. Your rides shouldn't
            be overpowered dei ex machina, but useful tools. So what does "traveling arsenal" mean? It's already
            pretty descriptive, figure it out on you own, chumhead.</p>
          <h3>Crew Cash</h3>
          <p>The other big thing your crew needs to keep track of is money. Specifically in 2 separate ways:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>The total amount of money your crew has generated. Acts as a gauge for your crew's notoreity and the
              abilities of its members. When your crew has an amount set by the GM, say like $10k, your joker skills
              level up.</li>
            <li>The current balance of the crew's account and a note of impending payments at the end of the month.
              Knowing this information is a good propellant for the types of missions you might want to undertake,
              and when the extremely scary people you owe money to will come after you.</li>

          <p>There is no XP in DECKJAMMERS. Instead, you take the cash money you get for completing assignments,
            beating fools, legitimate business enterprises (lol), and outright theft and you turn that into new
            and better gear, and new and better skills (which are in the next section). Nevertheless, your crew
            or the GM should keep a running total of money earned as a general gauge for your crew’s progress.</p>
          <p>At character creation, you’ll start out with $473 each—it’s all you were able to scrounge together,
            divided by how many of you there are in your crew. It’s not much, but it’s enough to get started.
            Especially in a world where you can bet just about everyone is kitted out in some way or another. In
            other words: unless you buy some cool-ass fists, your punches ain't doing shit to nobody. With $473
            you won’t be able to afford any of the highest-tech gear and cybernetics of course, but that money’s
            good at Crazy Hakeem’s Discount Gun Emporium and Dok Roberks’ Bakkalley Kcybers, which are as good as
            places as any to get started. Oh, and there’s always the more legitimate outfits as well, like Lexwell
            Cybernetics, Inc., but given your abysmal credit history, the interest rate on the loan they give you
            is going to be killer. Probably literally if you miss a payment. But seriously, your interest rate is
            31.4%.</p>
          <p>Cybernetics are limited by your body. Meaning, you have two eyes, so unless you shell out for a third,
            you can only take two eye skills. If some cyber part replaces, for example, both legs, then you can’t
            take another leg enhancement. Use common sense here.</p>
          <p>Some of these give you a new attack--jot that down on your sheet somewhere, you can use those like you
            would a melee weapon or gun or something. Others might tell you you have a new skill, in which case
            you'd add a skill you bought outright (again, covered in the next section).</p>
          <p>You might notice there’s no armor. Duh. Who the hell wears armor in an urban proletarian hellscape?
            This isn’t Mad Max.</p>

          <h2>SKILLS</h2>
          <p>You purchase skills like you would gear. When purchasing skills, you have two options. First, you can
            buy a new skill, which you then assign to a particular card: suit and number, like <black>4♣</black>. Second,
            you can improve your expertise at a skill, where you then assign that skill to another card. Doing this
            though costs 50% more than the previous time you bought that skill. Because the value of the card is
            replaced by a skill, it’s a smart move to start assigning skills at the 2s and move upwards from there.</p>
          <p>Unlike gear, skills come in tiers, grouped by cost. At higher tiers, the skills will be a combination
            of more interesting, better, more niche, having prerequisites, and so on.</p>
          <p>Oh, you also get to start with a joker skill. These are bigger and splashier than
            other skills. After you play a <joker>joker</joker> in combat, take it out of your deck until the end of the combat
            encounter. They're also more archetypal, a signature ultimate action. They should in some way be tied
            to your character's cybernetic enhancements, favored weapon, or at the very least your highest, bestest
            attribute. Below are some examples, but feel free to make up one that works for you, your crew, and
            your GM. Can’t be too overpowered, right? You choose one at character creation, [and it gets stronger
            at regular intervals, which is why it’s important to keep track of the crew’s gross earnings.]</p>
          <p>Some of the skills look like they’re items. That’s because they are. Items are special
            once-per-encounter skills that you take out of your deck instead of into your discard after you play
            them, like with joker skills.</p>

          <h3>Checks</h3>
          <p>Your GM will ask you to make a check if you’re trying to do something that requires more than a
            normal amount of skill or expertise. Normal movement, talking, reading—all that stuff just happens.
            But let’s say you’re trying to jump across to the next building, convince an NPC to do something,
            hold a door shut, hack into a system, pickpocket a fool—time to make a check.</p>
          <p>To make a check, flip, from a freshly shuffled deck, cards equal to your the score in the relevant
            attribute. Look back up at what attributes cover and make the best choice here. If what you’re
            trying to do saddles the line between a couple attributes, you can argue your case and how you’ll
            try to accomplish what you’re going for to the GM. If he/she finds that reasonable, go for it.</p>
          <p>From those cards you flipped, choose the two highest values, add them up, and add your attribute
            score to that. Tell the GM the total. For a relatively doable task, you’re looking to hit a 13.
            Harder tasks scale up from there to 30, which is an almost-impossible task. If it’s a task someone
            can reasonably help you with (meaning they have at least 3 in that attribute), they help you by
            letting you draw an extra card.</p>
          <p>Here are the exceptions and caveats and special rules. Aces here work differently: a <black>black
            ace</black> means you caught a break so all your <black>black</black> cards are worth +2 (which
            also means that ace is worth 14+2=16); flipping a <red>red ace</red> means something messed up
            and all <red>red</red> cards you flipped are worth just 2. If you flip a <joker>joker</joker>,
            you can either replace one of the cards you flipped or flip an additional card. If one of the
            cards you flip is a skill, instead of choosing two cards to use on the check, you can instead
            choose one and double its value.</p>
          <p>Sometimes things happen to you and you have to react. For example, someone might be trying to
            sneak up on you, or you might have walked into a trap, or what you’re doing might trigger a silent
            alarm. In these situations, you’re making a reaction check. The GM will tell you to flip a card
            in reaction and will tell you the attribute you’re reacting with (like if your crew is walking
            through an alley and into a net trap nobody saw, footwork would help you jump out of the way).
            Refer to this chart to the right to see what you need to flip to succeed. Unlike in proactive
            checks, flipping aces in reactive checks do not crit.</p>
          <p>You always shuffle after a skill check.</p>

          <strong>Example: Checks</strong>
          <p>R4mb0 wants to defuse a bomb he found under his motorcycle. He’ll need to use smarts to figure
            out which wire to cut. He’s got 3 in smarts.</p>
          <p>The GM decides this is a pretty shitty homemade bomb, so R4mb0’s target is 18: tough, but not impossible.</p>
          <p>R4mb0 flips 3 cards: <red>6♥</red>, <red>2♥</red>, <red>4♥</red>. Not great, but he slotted the
            Heavy Smash skill into <red>2♥</red>. That means he can double the value of a card, but 12 isn’t
            good enough. The bomb explodes.</p>
          <p>The GM decides that he can make a reaction check. His 4 points in footwork means he needs to flip black.</p>
          <p>R4mb0 flips <black>9♠</black>. He’s able to jump away in time, but his bike’s totally trashed.</p>

          <h3>Combat encounters</h3>
          <p>Before a combat encounter gets under way, the GM will first give your crew a layout of the area,
            including buildings, objects usable for cover, and where the bad guys are that are in your crew’s
            line of sight (or that have otherwise given themselves away). You also figure out initiative order,
            which is described in the attributes section.</p>
          <p>At the beginning of your turn in an encounter, you draw up to your max hand size, which starts at
            5 cards. On your turn, you can do as much as little as you want, provided you have the cards.</p>
          <p>If you want to move, discard a card from your hand to move up to your max (see attributes). Standing
            up from being knocked down counts as a move as well.</p>
          <p>The most common basic actions in combat are melee and ranged attacks, but skills, reloading, and
            item use are also considered actions. Any actions not explicitly listed here, like grappling, dragging,
            etc., are still actions. All actions will require you to play 2 cards. For melee and ranged attacks,
            choose two cards, add their values, and add your relevant attribute score—for melee that’s generally
            toughness, for ranged that’s generally handeye (your gear or cyberware will tell you if you’ve got
            more or different options). Your attack hits if your total action value is higher than 13 + target’s
            relevant attribute (footwork to avoid a ranged attack, toughness to deflect a melee attack).</p>
          <p>Ranged attacks and some actions given by cybernetics list their effective range in squares. This does
            not mean they are worthless outside of those ranges, but for every 1sq beyond the range, add 2 to the
            target score needed for a hit.</p>
          <p>To reload, make sure you have ammo available, then discard any two cards in your hand. To use an item,
            discard another card and remove the item card from your deck until the end of the encounter. For skills,
            you play the skill card with another card in your hand. Your total action value is 2x the value of the
            second card plus your relevant attribute score.</p>
          <p>Repairing stuff uses your smarts attribute. If something is damaged, it takes one turn to repair during
            combat. If something is broken, it can't be repaired during combat but can be with time outside of combat.</p>
          <p>Aces count as 14s—the highest value card—and if played with a face card or a skill card, you critically
            hit, doing +1 damage and forcing the target to discard a card. Critical hits can be defended, but you
            can’t escape unscathed: you still take 1 damage total if you defend.</p>
          <p>Playing a <joker>joker</joker> activates your joker skill. After your joker skill resolves, remove the
            <joker>joker</joker> from your deck until the end of the encounter and shuffle.</p>
          <p>You (well, everyone) can also defend against attacks. To defend, you need to have cards in your hand—if
            you played them all on your turn, you can’t defend (remember, you only draw at the beginning of your turn).
            To defend an attack, you discard a card from your hand, but by doing so you reduce your max hand size by
            1 until you rest.</p>
          <p>Resting is a special action. You have to rest if you have no cards in your deck at the beginning of your
            turn, but you can also choose to rest on your turn. Resting takes your entire turn—you can’t attack then
            rest, or move then rest—but it lets you shuffle. You don’t regain any HP or anything though. Remember,
            you only draw your hand at the beginning of your turns, which means you don’t draw after you rest until
            it’s your turn again.</p>
          <p>HPs, getting KO’d, and dying are all covered in the attribute section. One note though: if you are KO’d
            and need to flip but you have no deck, you shuffle then flip.</p>
          <p>Disarming does what it says on the box: the target of a disarming attack drops their weapon, and sometimes
            it gets flung away. When someone gets disarmed, they flip: <red>red</red> face, the weapon is damaged (broken
            if <red>red ace</red>); otherwise, no problems.</p>
          <p>You always shuffle after a combat encounter.</p>

          <strong>Example: combat encounters</strong>
          <p>R4mb0 and Devochkill are confronted in an alley by two members of the Country Club Boys. It’s a kind of
            wide alley, but there’s a large dumpster near our heroes and a fire escape near the CCBs on the western
            building. There’s trash everywhere and a couple rats skitter away.</p>
          <p>The CCBs flip a <black>J♣</black> (+3 footwork) and win initiative, then it’s Devochkill (flipped <red>8♥</red>+3)
            and R4mb0 (flipped <black>4♠</black>+4). The GM draws hands for the CCBs, and the players draw for themselves.</p>
          <p><em>Round 1</em>: One of the CCBs, let’s call him Don, discards 1 to climb up onto the fire escape. He takes
            a shot at Devochkill, playing <red>K♦</red>+<black>9♣</black>+3=25. Devochkill’s only got a toughness of 2
            and hates getting chumped on the first round, so she discards a card to defend, avoiding the shot.</p>
          <p>The other CCB, Ald, charges at R4mb0 with his baseball bat. He discards 1 to run up, then plays
            <red>9♦</red>+<red>10♥</red>+3=22. That’s more than R4mb0’s 18 (13+5 toughness), so he takes 1 damage,
            putting him at 5/6 HP.</p>
          <p>Because Devochkill defended Don’s attack, she can’t dive behind the dumpster like she wanted, so she just
            stays put and shoots at Ald with her shotgun, playing <red>5♥</red>+<black>J♠</black>+4=20, dealing 1 damage.
            She then uses her <red>3♥</red> skill—Eye Laser: Superman Style—with a 7 for a total of 2x7+4=18, again dealing
            damage to Ald.</p>
          <p>R4mb0 knows that Ald’s hurting bad, so he plays <red>A♥</red>+<red>Q♥</red>+5 to smash him with his hammer,
            dealing a critical hit. Ald has to defend or he’d be KO’d, so he discards a card, only taking 1 damage. R4mb0’s
            pissed that Ald defended, so he attacks again: <black>J♠</black>+<red>7♥</red>+5=23. Again, Ald has to defend,
            discarding his last card. With his last card, R4mb0 discards to duck behind the dumpster.</p>
          <p><em>Round 2</em>: Don draws back up to 5. From his vantage point, he’s going to take 2 shots at Devochkill
            since he can’t see R4mb0 anymore. He plays <black>6♣</black>+<black>Q♠</black>+3=21 and <black>10♠</black>+<red>10♦</red>+3=23.
            Devochkill can take them both and she will because she doesn’t want to be at further card disadvantage.</p>
          <p>Ald can only draw 3 cards since he defended twice. Knowing he’ll probably die next turn, he’ll discard one
            to move up to Devochkill—maybe he can take her with him. He plays <black>8♣</black>+<black>K♠</black>+3=24.
            Devochkill is pissed she has to defend again so she won’t get KO’d by this dick, so she does.</p>
          <p>Devochkill can only draw up to 3 cards, but she smiles when she sees what she drew. She plays <red>2♥</red>,
            which is her grenade, with a <black>10♠</black>, totalling 10x2+4=24, lobbing it at Don. Don knows he’s screwed
            because the only way he can dodge the blast damage from the grenade is to jump off of the fire escape, but he
            does it anyway, discarding. Because he fell 2sq though, he takes 1 damage. The GM figures that he’ll have to
            evade the falling fire escape as well, so she has Don make a reaction check. His footwork is 3, so all he has to
            flip is <black>black</black>, but he flips <red>8♥</red>. He takes another damage, is disarmed, knocked down, and pinned.</p>
          <p>R4mb0 knows Ald has no cards left, so he draws up and plays <black>K♠</black>+<red>6♥</red>+5=24 to cave in
            Ald’s skull. He discards 1 to move up to Don. He sticks his sledgehammer in Don’s face then asks him if he’d
            rather die right here, right now, or if he’d like to explain why these fancy boys were so far out of their
            territory. Don says he’ll talk.</p>
          <p><em>Wrap-up</em>: Don and Ald had $57 on them, plus an SMG and a baseball bat. Don tells your crew that their
            leader, Green Jacket, is looking to expand his territory and was putting out feelers for easy pickings.</p>

          <h3>Other rules</h3>
          <p>Falling damage: 1 per every 2sq you fall straight down (this is assuming you’ve failed a reaction check or
            intentionally chose to fall or jump)</p>
          <p>Switching weapons is a free action, meaning you can just do it. If you pick up a foe’s gun, flip for black to
            see if it’s loaded. The value of the black card you flip is how many rounds are loaded, up to the gun’s max.</p>
          <p>Driving checks, both proactive and reactive, are going to be handeye. The difficulty of succeeding on a check
            should consider the quality of your vehicle, your familiarity with it, driving and road conditions, and what
            you’re trying to accomplish. Again, normal driving is a normal thing and doesn’t need a check.</p>
          <p>If you flip a <joker>joker</joker>, your joker skill does not activate. You’ll succeed at whatever it was you
            flipped for no doubt, but the <joker>joker</joker> skips your hand and goes straight to the discard pile.</p>
          <p>Yes, you can try to harvest cybernetics from fallen enemies. It is very hard to do it yourself, but you can
            also pay one of Dok Roberks’ interns to do it for you. To do it yourself, you need to succeed on both a smarts
            and a handeye check. It’s delicate work so nobody can help you out. The targets for those checks are at the GM’s
            discretion and should take into consideration your familiarity with cybernetics, that particular part/part of
            the body, and any studying you’ve done on the subject. 25 is about right though for a precision job.</p>
          <p>Yes, you can try to implant cybernetics you’ve harvested or found by yourself. Again, it’s hard to do, but you
            can keep shelling out to those interns if you need to. To do it yourself to another crew member, you need to
            succeed on both a smarts and a handeye check. The same stipulations and caveats from harvesting apply here too.</p>
          <p>Selling stuff you don’t want, like weapons and cybernetics, will give you 50% of its cost on the black market
            if it’s in good condition. 25% if it’s damaged. Use normal rounding rules, nobody deals in parts of dollars anymore.</p>
          <p>It’s up to the GM to decide how time works, especially like when it’s been a month. A general rule of thumb
            though is that you and your crew can knock out one big job—a heist, an assassination, a recon, a shipment delivery,
            a meetup with a new contact—every week.</p>

          <h3>Flip</h3>
          <p>Most checks are resolved by flipping cards. Checks can be proactive (player-initiated) or reactive
            (GM-initiated).</p>
          <p><strong>Proactive</strong>: flip X, where X is the number of points in the relevant attribute. Add the two highest
            values and your attribute score. If the total meets or exceeds the target, you succeed. A target of 13
            requires a bit of effort, 30 is almost impossible. The GM determines the target before you flip.
            If you flip a <black>black ace</black>, all your <black>black</black> cards are +2. If you flip a
            <red>red ace</red>, the value of all your <red>red</red> cards are 2. If you flip a <joker>joker</joker>
            you can either replace a card or flip an additional card. If you flip a skill card, choose one card
            you flipped and double its value.</p>
          <p><strong>Reactive</strong>: flip 1. Your attribute score determines the target you need to flip: 5+ needs ≥5,
            3-4 needs <black>black</black>, 1-2 needs face or ace, 0 needs ace. Flipping a <joker>joker</joker>
            is an automatic success. Aces have no additional effect, nor do skill cards.</p>

          <h3>Combat</h3>
          <p>Initiative order: flip 1 + footwork.</p>
          <p>Starting hand size is 5, draw up to it.</p>
          <ul class="pl-0">
            <li><strong>Movement</strong>: discard a card, move up to your max</li>
            <li><strong>Melee attack</strong>: add values of 2 cards + toughness*, target = 13 + opponent's
              toughness</li>
            <li><strong>Ranged attack</strong>: add values of 2 cards + handeye*, target = 13 + opponent's
              footwork</li>
            <li><strong>Reload</strong>: discard two cards</li>
            <li><strong>Skills</strong>: double value of one card + relevent attribute for the action
              (skills that are items or do not modify an attack must still be played with a second card)</li>
            <li><strong><joker>Joker</joker></strong>: activates your joker skill, then remove this card from
              your deck and reshuffle</li>
            <li><strong>Repair</strong>: add values of 2 cards + smarts, target determined by GM depending on
              how damaged the item is</li>
            <li><strong>Defend</strong>: discard a card and reduced your hand size by 1</li>
            <li><strong>Rest</strong>: discard as many cards as you like and reshuffle (you have to rest if
              your deck is empty, and you cannot take any other actions on turns when you rest)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>* some gear or skills might tell you to use a different attribute</p>
